You can use Agent Cloud locally on your machine to build your projects and this is the simplest way to get Agent Cloud up and running. It only takes a few minutes.

## Setup via Docker

Learn how to get Agent Cloud running locally via Docker.

    <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the repository locally">
        Open your terminal and clone the repo to your a local folder using the command below.
        Make sure to ```cd``` into that directory.

        ```git clone https://github.com/rnadigital/agentcloud.git```

        <Info>
            There previously was a reliance on GCP for bucket storage.
            This has been removed and is now optional.
            Files can now be accessed from Local Disk.
        </Info>

        Follow the steps below to get started:
        Once you are in the directory of the repo for Mac & Linux users run:
        ```
        chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
        ```

        The script will prompt for some details, or you can pass them as command line arguments:

        ```
        ~$ ./install.sh --help
        Usage: ./install.sh [options]
        Options:
        --project-id ID                  Specify the GCP project ID.
        --service-account-json PATH      Specify the file path of your GCP service account json.
        --gcs-bucket-name NAME           Specify the GCS bucket name to use.
        --gcs-bucket-location LOCATION   Specify the GCS bucket location.
        -h, --help                       Display this help message.
        ```

        Here is a sample you can use to fill in the blanks
        ```
        ./install.sh --project-id [INSERT PROJECT ID HERE] --service-account-json [GENERATE A SERVICE ACCOUNT IN GCP AND INSERT LOCAL PATH TO KEYFILE JSON PATH] --gcs-bucket-name [INSERT A GCP BUCKET NAME] --gcs-bucket-location [INSERT A GCP LOCATION E.G. US-CENTRAL1] --openai-api-key [INSERT KEY SK-.......]
        ```

### System Requirements

<Warning>
    To ensure optimal performance and stability when running AgentCloud, please ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
</Warning>

**Memory (RAM):**
1. Minimum of 16GB RAM is recommended for optimal performance. However, it's essential to allocate sufficient memory based on your specific usage.
2. Actual memory usage may vary depending on factors such as dataset size and project complexity.
3. During testing, typical memory usage ranges from 8GB to 10GB, including the operating system and other concurrently running programs within Docker.

**Recommended RAM If Running Embeddings Locally:**
- üöÄ Minimum of (16-32 GB) for optimal performance.
- ‚ùå Avoid using 8 GB.
- üí° Consider 32 GB for excellent performance.

**Disk Space:**
- Minimum of 20 GB of free disk space.

**Docker Resource Allocation:**
- It's crucial to allocate sufficient resources to Docker itself, especially if running AgentCloud within Docker containers.

<Info>
    Please note that the actual resource requirements may vary depending on the specific usage and workload of your AgentCloud deployment.
