## What is Agent Cloud
Agent Cloud enables companies to host their own AI App platform.

### Imagine having your own Open AI GPT builder platform
Except with 4 key differences:
1. Self host it on your companies cloud (keeping your data secure) - for open source users only
2. Connect to any LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, Open AI, Azure Open AI - with more coming)
3. Create RAG chat apps that connect to more than just files, and can sync data from [hundreds of datasources](https://agentcloud.dev/integrations)
4. Create multi agent apps that can help you automate manual processes
